# Incorporation of JS

JavaScript will be used on the "Create Music" page to make it much more interactive and allow users to make their own rhythms. It would control the system of the page such as sound, user input, tempo, and much more. The user will be able to arrange their beats for JavaScript to store the data and play it back for the maker to hear. Additionally, the use of JavaScript will allow the user to save their own work and upload it to the "Community Creations" page. Lastly, JavaScript will be included to be used in the "Games & Quizzes" page to track player input, scores, and much more.
