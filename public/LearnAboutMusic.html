                <h3> The Middle Ages </h3>
                    <p> <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
                        At the very least for Western music, the Middle Ages could be said to be the period in which the foundation of music began. 
                        From polyphony, to notation, to harmony, all of these ideas and concepts were brought to their early stages in this period. 
                        In the Medieval period, music was mostly religious, and it was heavily influenced by the Church. 
                        Although there were secular pieces performed by traveling musicians, 
                        and although music was actually considered as part of the quadrivium - a Medieval university curriculum for the 
                        mathematical arts - at this time, it was mostly used by the Church for Christian worship, a way to honor God and not part of entertainment.
                    </p> <!-- Paragraph 1 -->

                    <p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->
                        In around the years of 590-604 AD, the Gregorian Chant was developed,
                        a collection of Plain Chants that were organized by Pope Gregory I, hence the name. 
                        Through the Gregorian Chant, the system of musical notation was developed, 
                        the system of written or visually recorded notes which would allow performers to 
                        actually perform the music as they could now interpret the pitch, melodies, and durations of music. 
                        However, the system they used back then was different from the modern times, as they used Neumes, 
                        something which looks similar but is pretty different to our current system. 
                        The reason for this development was because the Church wanted to preserve music and make people memorize the chants. 
                        It also allowed them to teach the chants.
                    </p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->

                    <p> <!-- Paragraph 3-->
                        In 695, the organum was developed. It was a simple plainchant melody, but there was an added voice to it. 
                        This would later lead to the development of polyphony. For now, moving on from that, 
                        the modern notation system was developed by Guido de Arezzo. In the years of 1160 to 1250, 
                        the Notre Dame School of Polyphony was established, a group of composers that worked near the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. 
                        The most famous composers, mainly because they are the only ones we remember, are Pérotin and Léonin, 
                        both composers of the polyphonic organum. Both of them were crucial in developing early polyphony, 
                        but Pérotin is largely regarded as more important. While Léonin helped in developing the two-voice polyphony, 
                        Pérotin expanded this polyphony up to four voices and included a rhythmic organization.
